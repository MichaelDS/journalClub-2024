Lloyd Shapley's paper, "Notes on the n-Person Game -- II: The Value of an n-Person Game," is a fundamental work in cooperative game theory. 
In this paper, Shapley focuses on the concept of the "value" of a cooperative game involving multiple players (an n-person game).

Key Points:

Cooperative Game Theory: Cooperative game theory deals with situations where a group of players can form coalitions and c
ooperate to achieve some common objective or to distribute some joint benefit. Shapley's paper delves into the mathematics of such cooperative games.

The Shapley Value: The central contribution of the paper is the introduction of the Shapley value, which is a method to 
fairly allocate the worth or value of a cooperative game among its participants. It provides a way to distribute the gains 
from cooperation in a manner that is considered equitable.

Fairness and Efficiency: Shapley's approach to the Shapley value is guided by principles of fairness and efficiency. 
The Shapley value ensures that each player is compensated in proportion to their marginal contribution to every possible coalition in the game.

Calculation Method: The paper outlines a systematic method for calculating the Shapley value for each player in an n-person cooperative game. 
It involves considering all possible permutations of players and determining their marginal contributions to each coalition.

Applications: The Shapley value has found applications in various fields, including economics, political science, and operations research. 
It provides a way to analyze and allocate the value generated by cooperative endeavors, such as the division of profits in a business partnership.

In summary, Lloyd S. Shapley's paper, "Notes on the n-Person Game -- II: The Value of an n-Person Game," introduces the concept of the Shapley value,
which has become a fundamental tool in cooperative game theory. This value allocation method ensures fairness and
efficiency in the distribution of gains from cooperation among multiple players.
